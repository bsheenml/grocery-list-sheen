### Grocery List App

**React + Firebase using Hooks and Firestore

This project follows the [LogRocket React + Firebase Tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-hooks-with-firebase-firestore/) to build a Grocery List app from scratch using Create React App.

## Motivation

After cloning, modifying, and deploying multiple React + Firbase apps, I wanted to build one from scratch using Create React App. My goal is to practice my git commit flow while helping to ingrain the process of deploying a secure React + Firebase app to memory.

After deploying the the basic app from tutorial, I would like to add Material UI design elements, and configure testing.

## Installation
